---

Once completed, your **AWS CLI** is successfully configured and ready to use!

```
```
## 2. Set up ECS Cluster and ECR Repository

To deploy the **Ping Pong Game** using **Amazon ECS**, follow these steps:

### 2.1 Create IAM Roles and Policies

Before deploying the container, we need to set up **IAM (Identity and Access Management)** roles to give **ECS** the necessary permissions to run tasks securely.

#### 2.2 Create a Role for ECS Tasks:
1. Navigate to the **IAM Console** > **Roles** > **Create role**.
2. Select **AWS Service** > **Elastic Container Service** > **Elastic Container Service Task**.
3. Attach the following policies:
   - **AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy**
4. Name the role (e.g., `ECSTaskExecutionRole`) and click **Create Role**.

This role will allow **ECS** to pull container images from **ECR** and send logs to **CloudWatch**.

---

### 3. Create an Amazon ECR Repository

**Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)** is a managed Docker container registry that helps store and manage your container images.

#### 3.1 To create an ECR repository:
1. Open the **ECR Console** in the AWS Management Console.
2. Click **Create repository**.
3. Choose the repository name (e.g., `ping-pong-game-repo`).
4. Leave the defaults for encryption unless specific encryption settings are required.
5. Click **Create repository**.
6. Copy the repository **URI** (e.g., `097670902547.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/ping-pong-game-repo`) for later use.

---

### 4. Create an ECS Cluster

An **ECS Cluster** is responsible for managing the compute resources needed to run your tasks.

#### 4.1 To create an ECS Cluster:
1. Open the **ECS Console**.
2. Click **Clusters** > **Create Cluster**.
3. Provide a cluster name (e.g., `ping-pong-game-cluster`).
4. Choose **AWS Fargate** for a serverless setup.
5. Keep the rest as default and click **Create** to finalize the cluster.

---

### 5. Define an ECS Task Definition

A **Task Definition** is a blueprint that defines how a container should run, including the image, memory, CPU, networking, and logging.

#### 5.1 To define a Task Definition:
1. Go to the **ECS Console** > **Task Definitions** > **Create New Task Definition**.
2. Give a task definition family name (e.g., `ping-pong-task`).
3. Choose **Fargate** as the launch type.
4. Specify the following:
   - **Task Role:** Select the IAM role (`ECSTaskExecutionRole`).
   - **Container Definitions:**
     - **Container name:** `ping-pong-container`.
     - **Image:** Add the ECR URI that you copied previously (e.g., `097670902547.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/ping-pong-game-repo:latest`).
5. Leave the rest as default.
6. Click **Create** to save the task definition.

Now, the task definition is set, and **ECS** knows how to run your container.

---

### 6. Set Up an ECS Service

An **ECS Service** ensures that your application is always running and manages the number of task instances.

#### 6.1 To set up an ECS Service:
1. Go to the **ECS Console** > **Clusters** > **ping-pong-game-cluster** > **Create Service**.
2. Choose:
   - **Launch type:** Fargate.
   - **Task definition:** Select the one created earlier.
   - **Service name:** `ping-pong-service`.
   - **Desired Number of tasks:** 1.
3. Leave everything else as default.
4. Click **Create Service**.

Your **Ping Pong Game** is now running as an **ECS Service**!

## 7. Prepare the Ping Pong Game Code

To deploy the **Ping Pong Game**, follow these steps:

### 7.1 Clone the Website Code

The website code for the **Ping Pong Game** is already provided. To get this code, open your preferred IDE and terminal, then run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yash5103/Pong-game.git
cd Pong-game
```
---

### 7.2 Run a Docker Container and Push to ECR

The cloned project includes a `Dockerfile` that defines how to containerize the **Ping Pong Game**. We'll run the container locally, then push it to **Amazon ECR**.

#### 📄 Dockerfile Overview:

```dockerfile
# Use the official Nginx image as the base
FROM nginx:latest

# Copy the Ping Pong Game files to the Nginx web root
COPY . /usr/share/nginx/html

# Expose the default Nginx HTTP port
EXPOSE 80

# Start Nginx when the container starts
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

This `Dockerfile` sets up a lightweight container using the Nginx web server to serve the **Ping Pong Game** over HTTP.

---

#### 7.3 Build the Docker Image

Make sure Docker Desktop is running, then run:

```bash
docker build -t ping-pong-game .
```

For Macs with Apple Silicon (M series chips), Docker image is built for arm64, but the AWS Fargate expects x86_64 (Intel/AMD architecture)
Add --platform=linux/amd64 in the Docker build command.

```bash
docker build --platform=linux/amd64 -t ping-pong-game .
```
---

#### 🏷7.4 Tag the Docker Image for ECR

Replace `<ECR_URI>` with your actual ECR repository URI:

```bash
docker tag ping-pong-game:latest <ECR_URI>:latest
```

Example:

```bash
docker tag ping-pong-game:latest 097670902547.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/ping-pong-game-repo:latest
```

---

#### 7.5 Push the Image to ECR

Authenticate with ECR:

```bash
aws ecr get-login-password --region eu-north-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <ECR_URI>
```

Push the image:

```bash
docker push <ECR_URI>:latest
```

---

#### 7.6 Verify the Image in ECR

Go to the **ECR Console** and check if the image appears under your repository (e.g., `ping-pong-game-repo`).

```

---

```
## 7.7 Access the Website through ECS URL

```
## 🚀 10. Set Up CodePipeline for Continuous Deployment – Ping Pong Game

---

### ✅ STEPS TO BE PERFORMED:

1. Create an AWS CodePipeline  
2. Test the Pipeline  

---

### 🏗️ 10.1 Create an AWS CodePipeline

AWS CodePipeline connects different stages of your CI/CD process. We’ll define how updates in your GitHub repo will trigger builds and deployments to ECS.

---

#### ▶️ Step 1: Navigate to CodePipeline Console

- Go to [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/)  
- Search for **CodePipeline** in the search bar  
- Click to open the **CodePipeline Console**

---

#### ▶️ Step 2: Create a New Pipeline

- Click **Create pipeline**  
- Choose **Build your own pipeline**  
- Click **Next**

##### 🔧 Pipeline Configuration:

- **Pipeline name**: `pingpong-game-pipeline`  
- **Service Role**: Select **Create a new service role**  
- **Role name**: `codePipelineServiceRole`  
- Click **Next**

---

#### ▶️ Step 3: Add Source Stage (GitHub)

This step tells CodePipeline where to pull the latest source code.

##### 🔧 Source Configuration:

- **Source Provider**: GitHub (via OAuth App)  
- Click **Connect to GitHub**  
  - Authorize AWS to access your GitHub account (if not already done)  
- **Repository**: Select your GitHub repo for Ping Pong Game  
- **Branch**: Select `main`  
- Click **Next**

---

#### ▶️ Step 4: Add Build Stage (CodeBuild)

CodeBuild will build and test the application.

##### 🔧 Build Configuration:

- **Build Provider**: AWS CodeBuild  
- **Project Name**: Select the project you created earlier (e.g., `pingpong-game-build`)  
- Leave other options as default  
- Click **Next**
- Skip test stage 

---

#### ▶️ Step 5: Add Deploy Stage (ECS Deployment)

Once built, the app is deployed to Amazon ECS automatically.

##### 🔧 Deploy Configuration:

- **Deploy Provider**: Amazon ECS  
- **Cluster**: Select your ECS Cluster (e.g., `pingpong-game-cluster`)  
- **Service**: Select your ECS Service (e.g., `pingpong-service`)  
- Leave the rest as default  
- Click **Next**

---

#### ▶️ Step 6: Review and Create Pipeline

- **Review all stages**: Source → Build → Deploy  
- If everything looks correct, click **Create pipeline**

📌 The pipeline will immediately begin running and execute each stage.

---

### 🧪 10.2 Test the Pipeline

Now let's test if the CI/CD pipeline works end-to-end.

---

#### ▶️ Step 1: Modify the Website Code

Update the game title in the frontend.

- Open `index.html`  
- Find the line(23) with:  <div class="game-title">Ping Pong</div>
- replace game name "Ping Pong" with your name "XYZ"
- save changes
 

---

#### ▶️ Step 2: Commit and Push the Change

Run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Changed game name to Ping Pong by YourName"
git push -u origin main
```

📌 Make sure you're on the `main` branch.

---

#### ▶️ Step 3: Monitor the Pipeline Execution

- Go to the **CodePipeline Console**
- Your pipeline (`pingpong-game-pipeline`) should automatically trigger
- Stages will run as follows:
  - **Source**: Pulls code from GitHub
  - **Build**: Runs `buildspec.yml`, builds image, pushes to ECR
  - **Deploy**: Deploys the latest image to ECS

📋 Monitor logs for each stage. If errors occur, check logs for more details.

---

#### ▶️ Step 4: Verify the Deployment

- Go to **ECS > Clusters > pingpong-game-cluster > Tasks tab**
- Click the latest **Task**
- Go to **Networking tab** and copy the **Public IP Address**
- Open your browser and go to:

```
http://<public_ip>:80
```
---

🎉 Congratulations! You've successfully set up a complete CI/CD pipeline for your **Ping Pong Game** using **AWS CodePipeline, ECS, ECR, S3, and CodeBuild**!
